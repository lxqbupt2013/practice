BEIJING - China will ship about 1,000 tons fresh water to water-starved Maldives via plane and vessel, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry and Defence Ministry on Saturday evening. 

About 150,000 residents are faced with water scarcity in Male, capital of Maldives, as a fire at the Maldives Water and Sewage Company damaged some of the company's equipments and forced suspension of water supply to Male on Thursday. 

In response to Maldivian government's request, China has provided emergency aid in cash and drinking water to the country, Chinese Foreign Ministry said. 

China has arranged delivery of bottled water in two Chinese civil aircrafts to Male. The first plane has arrived with 12 tons bottled water at 6 am Saturday morning local time, while the second one with eight tons will get there on Saturday night, Chinese foreign ministry said, adding that more water will be sent. 

An ocean rescue vessel of the Chinese navy suspended its escort mission and headed for Male port at 9 p.m. on Friday. With 960 tons fresh water and seawater desalting facility on board, the vessel is scheduled to arrive at the destination at 3 a.m. on Monday, Chinese Defense Ministry said. 

Aircrafts of Chinese air force have been ready for urgent rescue mission, and the Chinese side is applying for air route with relevant countries, the defense ministry added.
